	<h2> About me </h2>
		
	<p> 
	I have lived in Iowa City My entire life and love the town. I have may hobbies including hunting, fishing, carpentry, metal work, and mechanics. I would cosider myself a jack of
	all trades. I love riding my motorcycle in my free time probably more than I should because I have a very hard time following the speed limit! I curently live off campus with my
	wonder girlfriend of 7 years, Kelsie Stoddard. Kelsie recently bought a linen business and does linens for events like wededings and graduation parties. I spend most of my free time
	helping out with the business, outside or spending time with friends. 
	</p>

	<p>
	I would say one of the two most interesting things about me is that I own two exotic cats. They are savanahs which are a cross between a domestic cat and an African Serval cat.
	Their names are Dino & Nyx and they are the coolest pets I've ever seen. They are super friendly, trainable like a dog, use the toilet insted of a liter box, play fetch, walk 
	on a leash, are larger than normal cats and absolutley love water. If you ever get the chance to meet one take it without a doubt! The second intersting fact in that I love skydiving
	and all adrenaline sports. I've been skydiving many times and love racing dirtbikes and four wheelers.
