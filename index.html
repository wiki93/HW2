		<h2> About Me</h2>
		
		<p> 
		I have lived in Iowa City my entire life and love the town. I have many hobbies including hunting, fishing, carpentry, metal work, and mechanics. I would cosider myself a multi talented
		individual Because I can never put anything down until I know how to do it myself. I love riding my motorcycle in my free time probably more than I should because I have a hard time following
		the speed limit! I curently live off campus with my wonderful girlfriend of 7 years, Kelsie Stoddard. Kelsie recently bought a linen business and does linens for events like wededings and 
		graduation parties. I spend most of my free time helping out with the business, outside or spending time with Kelsie and friends. 
		</p>

		<p>
		I would say one of the two most interesting things about me is that Kelsie and I own two exotic cats. They are Savanahs which are a cross between a domestic cat and an African Serval cat.
		Their names are Dino & Nyx and they are the coolest pets I've ever seen. They are super friendly, trainable like a dog, use the toilet insted of a liter box, play fetch, walk 
		on a leash, are larger than normal cats and like water. If you ever get the chance to meet one take it without a doubt! The second intersting fact is that I love skydiving
		and all adrenaline sports. I've been skydiving many times and love racing dirtbikes and four wheelers.
